Yet another failed side project. Turn back before you are disappointed. The reality of this repository is that I had grand ideas (but I really wanted to learn how Web Audio works). I figured out the gist of how web audio works. So I stopped working on this crazy project. Read on if you must.

### Overview

The goal of this project is to make a JavaScript library that any web developer familiar with basic music theory and digital audio processing can use to make music. 

As a developer, I imagine I might have a new song pop into my head and I want to create it. BUT, it's been years since I've used a DAW and all I know how to do anymore is write code. What if I could sit down and use a library which would play a new sound when I defined a new class? And I could tell it how long to play, what effects to add, what waveform to use, how often to repeat... etc. 

This would allow songs to go through version control! An outsider could clone the song's repository and check out the first commit to see what the initial idea was and compare it to what the finished product became. How cool would that be!? 

I'm also imagining that songs written with this framework could be hosted on the web. A user could load the URL, hit a play button, and listen to what the developer created. 

I don't know what this project will look like yet and I don't know how long it will live. It's also my first JavaScript package that I've created. 

Any contributions or thoughts are welcome. 

### Quick Start

I've been using the ./dev-site folder to learn the ins and outs of the Web Audio API - which I'm thinking is what most of this framework will be built on. 

I haven't started this yet, but the framework code itself will be located in the `src` folder - as is customary. 

To start the practice development site, you'll want to execute the following: 

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Move into the `dev-site` folder. 
3. Run a local server with `npx serve`. Select to install the serve package if it asks. 
4. Point your browser to `localhost:[port]` and you're good to go!


P.S. If you're wondering about the song that's loaded into the page, I created it a loooong time ago with a friend. It's a cover of some great music by an artist called Singularity. This was back when dubstep was cool. :)
